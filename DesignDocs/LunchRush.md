# Lunch Rush Mini Game

## Premise: Fight your way to the counter to place and order and pick up your meal!

### Concept:
* Bumper-car-esque hungry-hungry hippos style game
* Navigate through a crowded lunch spot and place or pick up your order
* Get out without spilling or getting knocked over within the time limit
* Can make a silly environment like a chipolte knockoff or something of the sort
